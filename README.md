# robopunks-minting-website
NFT minting website where you can fully mint through a working smart contract. This project was inspired in the original RoboPunks.
Used Solidity, React, Ethers and Hardhat along with some other useful plugins.

Step by step:
```jsx
1. Write the RoboPunks Smart Contract using Solidity & OpenZeppelin.
2. This Smart Contract will mint an NFT whenever someone transfers Ethereum to the Smart Contract.
3. Finally, we will use Ethers.JS with React to build a Web3 Application that provides a Front-End interface where people can interact with the Smart Contract.
```

- [x] Wrote the RoboPunksNFT.sol contract using Solidity.
- [x] Used Infura to setup a node for ou DApp.
- [x] Created API key on for our project on Etherscan.
- [x] Deployed the smart contract to Goerli Testnet. See RoboPunksNFT deployed to: 0x58DDE549384b1D136D4000330aCaA553EbE1231D
- [x] Verified our Contract on Etherscan using the hardhat verify command.
- [x] Wrote the front-end code with React, having separated the App in 2 main components (Header & MainMint).
- [x] Used Chakra's pre-made components to help style our App (replaced the traditional html).
- [x] Finally, enabled public minting.
- [x] That's all :tada:
