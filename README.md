# robopunks-minting-website
NFT minting website where you can fully mint through a working smart contract. This project was inspired in EdRohâ€™s RoboPunks.
Used React, Ethers and Hardhat along with some other useful plugins.

Step by step:
```jsx
1. Write the RoboPunks Smart Contract using Solidity & OpenZeppelin.
2. This Smart Contract will mint an NFT whenever someone transfers Ethereum to the Smart Contract.
3. Finally, we will use Ethers.JS with React to build a Web3 Application that provides a Front-End interface where people can interact with the Smart Contract.
```
